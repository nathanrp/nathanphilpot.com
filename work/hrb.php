		<h3><abbr>H&amp;R</abbr> Block</h3>
		<p>Working at <abbr>H&amp;R</abbr> Block was a great experience. I worked with people that were truly passionate and cared about their customers. Because they cared, going through the discovery, research and design process was natural for them.</p>
		<p><abbr>H&amp;R</abbr> Block is the world&rsquo;s largest tax service provider. My first assignment there was to redesign their flagship tax preparation product. A channel responsible for a large portion of their multi-billion dollar revenue.</p>
		<p>I had a lot to learn. Like I said the people there were great. There was a lot of expertise and knowledge inside the building. I started talking to everyone. I also did a lot of field observation. This was invaluable. Seeing tax pros use the product and interact with their clients was key to building a great product and experience. Hands down the best way to improve the experience is to watch people using your products.</p>

		<p>As we started designing there were lots of white board conversations, technical discussions and testing <abbr>UI</abbr> design with users.</p>

		<p>Out of the research came lots of good insights. With this product there are thousands of screens and forms. The research helped us understand the users&rsquo; mental model and develop a set of principles to design by.</p>

		<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end. We continued to discover and design ways to help the tax pros and in turn provide outstanding service and value to <abbr>H&amp;R</abbr> Block&rsquo;s customers.</p>
