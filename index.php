		<p>I design usable interfaces and enjoyable user experiences. From small mobile apps to international enterprise solutions.</p>
		<p>Great ideas are a combination of data, research and going with your gut. Iterative prototyping, user testing, frequent interactions with members of the team, all this with the goal of learning, has yielded the best results for me. <abbr>UX</abbr> is all about the details, the <abbr>UX</abbr> is the product and shows how much you care. I think user feedback should <a href="https://medium.com/bringing-the-donuts/1818bb8c6ca8">inform product lists</a>.</p>
		<p>My process for designing a product is a combination of things I have learned and seen work. I am a big fan of <a href="https://medium.com/@nwalkingshaw/disruption-in-an-88-year-old-company-part-i-f63b9d81132c">Directed Discovery</a> (<abbr>DD</abbr>). I look for <a href="http://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/tanev/TTMG_5103/Articles/Christensen_Finding_the_right_job_for_your_product_MIT_Sloan_2007.pdf">jobs to be done</a>. <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033851.do"><i>User Story Mapping</i></a> has been a big influence.</p>
		<p>I try and approach new challenges with an open mind. Focusing on outcome and changing peoples lives. I always like to be a little out of my league, because then I know I am learning and growing.</p>
		<p>I believe design is honest.</p>
